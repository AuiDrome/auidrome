# AuiDrome

![Pair of Huia](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/00/Huia_Buller.jpg)

**Aui**: onomatopoeic fragment of the extinct Huia voice (trying to catch its "where-are-you" sound [0]).

**Drome**: a place where people can get in, and from some of them people can also get out.

In the context of a project, a good long project (e.g. a human life, a collective ambition, or a business line) there are 7 basic dromes:

1. **AuiDrome**: people that are coming soon or that are finally between us. Her or his name should be created using, of course, love, and optionally related to one of the languages of the different cultures of the world (e.g. choosing from Glottolog [1] or ISO 639-3 vocabularies [2]).

2. **AcadoDrome**: people that has started to learn things about the culture or cultures of her or his parents. This "drome" has three internal stages: play, learn and grant.


3. **PedaloDrome**: people currently doing their best for the project, working hard for it but also for the pleasure that doing it returns to them.

4. **ByebyeDrome**: farewell from the squad to those who decide to keep growing in other projects. A place to remember those riders and their stuff (twitter, skype, or whatever they choose to keep in contact with us).

5. **RestoDrome**: people who deserves to rest and give to the project whatever they want. They happily still read, hopefully write, and some of them can even keep making amazing things.

6. **RipoDrome**: people that is no longer between us but that their spirit keep pushing us to build a better world.

7. **LoveDrome**: people we love or admire regardless of the drome to which they belong (our affection is more important than where they are).

*Auidrome* is supposed to run on a collective or personal server and its data should be easily shared (like the *Smallest Federated Wiki[3]* does).

*Auidrome* is also desired to become *Hyperbooted[4]* to guarantee always **the rights of the user**.
